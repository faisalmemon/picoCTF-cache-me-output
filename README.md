# Writeup of PicoCTF challenge Cache Me Outside

For this write-up I used the work of [Dvd848](https://github.com/Dvd848/CTFs/blob/master/2021_picoCTF/Cache_Me_Outside.md) but I added my own thinking and problem solving ideas to complement the approach already described.

## Problem Description

AUTHOR: MADSTACKS
Description

While being super relevant with my meme references, I wrote a program to see how much you understand heap allocations. 

- `nc mercury.picoctf.net 36605`
- [heapedit](./heapedit) 
- [Makefile](./Makefile)
- [libc.so.6](./libc.so.6)

Hint
- It may be helpful to read a little bit on GLIBC's tcache.
